// Prepbuddy is very tasteful of clothes. He has N numbers of shirts hanging in the hanger in his wardrobe. Prepbuddy likes to 
// wear different colored clothes. So, whenever he see there are two or more shirts with the same color, he removes all the shirt 
// of that color from his wardrobe. Now, he wants to know how many M unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe. Prepbuddy 
// wants you to find M.
// Note: As there are many shades of a color so consider integers as a color name. i.e, color of shirt is 0,1,2, â€¦ , N.
